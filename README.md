### I'm a data scientist currently specializing in developing open-source tools for computational biology.

Check out the repos I've worked on:
* [SpaceCat](https://github.com/angelolab/SpaceCat): (Core Developer) A computational pipeline that automatically extracts a spatial catalog of
100s of distinct features from single cell data to enable easy downstream quantification. SpaceCat
features are normalized for comparison and simple integration with any statistical model.

<p>

* [ark-analysis](https://github.com/angelolab/ark-analysis): (Maintainer) A package for performing spatial analysis on highly multiplexed
imaging microscopy data. Provided researchers with a powerful suite of tools to analyze their
millions of cells automatically and efficiently.
* [toffy](https://github.com/angelolab/toffy) (Maintainer): A package for extracting and preprocessing image data generated from the
commercial MIBIScope platform. Provided researchers with an easy way to perform channel
compensation, background subtraction, and batch correction.
