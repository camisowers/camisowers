### Check out the repos I've worked on:
* [SpaceCat](https://github.com/angelolab/SpaceCat): (Core Developer) A computational pipeline that automatically extracts a spatial catalog of 100s
of distinct features from single cell data to enable easy downstream quantification. SpaceCat features have been normalized, correlation filtered, and pre-processed for quick integration with any statistical model.

* [ark-analysis](https://github.com/angelolab/ark-analysis): (Maintainer) A package for performing spatial analysis on highly multiplexed
imaging microscopy data, adapting machine learning techniques for automated biological analysis. Provides researchers with a powerful suite of tools (via user-friendly jupyter notebooks) to analyze their millions of cells automatically and efficiently.

* [toffy](https://github.com/angelolab/toffy) (Maintainer): A package for extracting and preprocessing image data generated from the
commercial MIBIScope platform. Provides researchers with an easy interface to efficiently perform channel
compensation, background subtraction, and batch correction without requiring users to have prior coding skills.
